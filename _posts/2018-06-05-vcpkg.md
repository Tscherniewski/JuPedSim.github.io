# Package installation using vcpkg

First install [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg):

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
 cd vcpkg
 .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```


For `JuPedSim` following C++ libraries are needed:

- Qt5
- VTK
- Boost
- CGAL (if AIROUTER is used)
- ZLIB

To install these libraries run the following:

```bash
 ./vcpkg.exe install qt5
 ./vcpkg.exe install vtk
 ./vcpkg.exe install boost-system boost-timer boost-test boost-filesystem
                     boost-chrono boost-geometry boost-graph
 ./vcpkg.exe install zlib:x86-windows-static
```

Now in order to compile a JuPedSim package (e.g. jpscore)

```bash
 cd jpscore
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:\\Directory\\where\\to\\find\\vcpkg\\scripts\\buildsystems\\vcpkg.cmake" ..
```

If this runs without errors, it means all requirements are fulfilled and you can proceed with the compilation

```bash
make
```

If you have a compiler (MinGW, or Cygwin)
Alternatively, in case you use Visual Studio you may need to
```bash
File -> Open -> Project/Solution
```
and select the Visual-Studio solution produced in the prior step by cmake (sln-file).
After a while when VS finishes indexing the project click on Build -> Build Solution.
